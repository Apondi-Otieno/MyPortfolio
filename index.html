            <h2> about me</h2>
            <p> My name is Beryl Apondi Otieno and there's nothing i love more than writing. I'm a writer,while
                everyone else was figuring out how to play in the sand,i was busy filling in my notebooks with
                words. Aside from passionately using words to describe life,i code, i'm currently enrolled at
                Moringa for the software development program. I have a background in pure and applied mathematics, i
                recently compeleted my bachelor's degree.
                <br>
                <br>
                I decided to study programming in order to acquire skills
                which would enable to create a diagnostic tool for mental healthcare in Africa and beyond, most mentally
                sick patients live their lives without ever finding out whether or not they are sick, a situation that
                leads to many deaths by suicide. on top of early intervention i'd like to apply my technical skills in
                helping children from abusive families find safe houses/foster parents/ support as they try to gain
                independence from their abusers.</p>
